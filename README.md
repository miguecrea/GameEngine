 # Combined AI behavior in Pacman Game
This is my reseach project for the course "Gameplay Programming" at Howest University of Applied Sciences.
The whole project is written in c++ and is made using the my own game engine which I developed for the course programming 4 . 
## What is this project about?
In my research I'm figuring out how to make a combined Ai behavior for the well known pacman game . 
My goal was to create a rather simple but engaging AI system that is fun to play and fits the scope of what we have
larned throughout the semester in the course gameplay programming

## Description of the Topic
###  AI Behavior Overview
The AI system controls ghost characters with different behavior patterns based on their type and state. The core components of the system are:

 ### Introduction to A*
A* is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm used in many games and applications. It aims to find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node by combining the advantages of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and Greedy Best-First-Search. The algorithm uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal, making it both complete and optimal.

### Relevance to Pacman
In the context of the Pacman game, A* is used to navigate the ghosts intelligently around the maze, chasing Pacman or fleeing to their home base. This makes the game more challenging and enjoyable by creating dynamic and unpredictable ghost behavior.

### Design and Implementation
Problem Definition
The goal is to implement the A* algorithm in a custom game engine to control the ghost's movement in a Pacman game. The ghosts should be able to find the shortest path to Pacman considering the layout of the maze.
but that is only the first step we ant to create an engaging Ai system that makes the ghost share information and work together in order to catch pacman 
## How is this implemented?
I started with a little setup creating the grid-based world and made an algorithm choice I went for the A *  which is a well known algoritm



## What are the results?
I'm really happy with the results, you can view them below!

## Next research topics
1. Interactive Environment: Make the environment more complex by adding traps, teleporters, or doors that open and close. Your algorithm will need to account for these interactions.
2. Reinforcement Learning: Integrate machine learning, where Pacman learns the optimal path or strategies based on rewards (like eating pellets) and penalties (like getting caught by ghosts).
Other also interesting features would be:
Complex Heuristics: Enhance the A* algorithm with more sophisticated heuristics that take into account ghost movements, dynamic changes in the maze, or the location of power pellets.
Probabilistic Heuristics: Introduce uncertainty in ghost movements and adapt your heuristics to account for this, leading to more robust pathfinding strategies.
